# Sorting
--------------------
## Bubble Sort
- inplace sorting algorithm
- stable sorting algorithm
- comparison based algorithm

### Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(1) 
- Adaptive: O(n) time when nearly sorted

--------------------
## insertion sort
- inplace sorting algorithm
- stable sorting algorithm
- comparison based algorithm
### Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Adaptive: O(n) time when nearly sorted
--------------------
## selection sort
- inplace sorting algorithm
- unstable sorting algorithm
- comparison based algorithm

### Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Adaptive: O(n^2) time when nearly sorted


--------------------
## merge sort
- not inplace sorting algorithm
- stable sorting algorithm
- comparison based algorithm

### Analysis
- Time complexity: O(nlogn)
- Space complexity: O(n) [o(n) for temp array+ o(logn) for recursion stack]
- Adaptive: O(nlogn) time when nearly sorted
